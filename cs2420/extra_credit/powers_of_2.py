#Write a program which quizes the user on all the powers of 2 from 0 through 49,
#in random order. If the user answers wrong, make them keep trying until they get it right.
#When they are done, print the total time it took.
#This program could be used to practice powers of 2, which every good computer scientist should have memorized!
#For less points, ask 50 random questions where repeats might be allowed.
#For more points, every question should be asked exactly once.

#               ideas
#make a text document with the powers of 2 and their answers
#make a class named powers that has a self.power and self.answer
#find a way to for the file to be used randomly and only read one at a time.
